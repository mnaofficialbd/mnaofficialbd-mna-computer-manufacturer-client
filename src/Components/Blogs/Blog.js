                What are the different ways to manage a state in a React
                application?

                The React State management is an essential component of React
                functions. There are some types of state we need to properly
                manage in our React apps: <br />
                Local state is important to change the local state only using
                the setState function as only then will React trigger a
                component re-render, which is essential for updating the
                application state.
                <br />
                Global state is necessary when we want to get and update data
                anywhere in our app, or in multiple components at least. <br />
                Server state is a simple concept, but can be hard to manage
                alongside all of our local and global UI state. <br />
                URL state is quite easy to manage, usually through custom hooks
                that give us all the information we need about our location,
                history, and pathname.

                How does prototypical inheritance work?
              </p>

                Prototypical inheritance is the key to understanding how objects
                inherit properties in JavaScript. Prototypical inheritance is
                that classical inheritance is limited to classes inheriting from
                other classes while prototypical inheritance supports the
                cloning of any object using an object linking mechanism.

                Why you do not set the state directly in React. For example, if
                you have const [products, setProducts] = useState([]). Why you
                do not set products = [...] instead, you use the setProducts.
              </p>

            <div className="  ">
              <p>
                We should never change or update the state directly in React.
                Because it won't re-render the component. If you immediately
                call setState. Optimized components might not re-render if you
                do, and the rendering bugs will be tricky to track down.

                You have an array of products. Each product has a name, price,
                description, etc. How will you implement a search to find
                products by name?

                We probably have use a for loop to iterate through all the items
                in the array. If we use find() method ,we can find the name
                element from products array. The find() method returns the value
                of the first element that passes a test. The find() method
                executes a function for each array element.

              What is a unit test? Why should write unit tests?

                unit testing is a software testing method by which individual
                units of source code sets of one or more computer program
                modules together with associated control data, usage procedures,
                and operating proceduresâ€”are tested to determine whether they
                are fit for use. Unit tests are typically automated tests
                written and run by software developers to ensure that a section
                of an application meets its design and behaves as intended.
